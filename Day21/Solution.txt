ReUsed Day19 code
WARNING, NO MATTER THE INPUT, THE CODE NEVER FINISHES
I looked for the input that checked reg[0] which was 28. I then looked for the condition which caused 28 to get triggered. this happened after around 1880 recurrsions. then it checked if the number in reg[1] was larger. if so the program would end. the number was 11285115 which when entering that number into AOC I had a correct answer.

Next, I made the program only print when reg[ip] = 28 and ran it with reg[0] = 0. I ran it for around 10 minutes to get 12000 values.
I then took the most recent value for reg[1] which was not a duplicate of the data. I believed the data would loop eventually so with
this method I took the last data before it loops which fills the criteria for part 2. 

Part 1 - 11285115
Part 2 - 2947113
